Â The Automated Test Generation System revolutionizes assessment creation in education by employing advanced Natural Language Processing. Its SubjectiveTest class dynamically generates contextually relevant subjective questions, while the ObjectiveTest class identifies trivial sentences for objective questions using NLP techniques. The system ensures efficiency, adaptability across subjects, and an enhanced learning experience by promoting critical thinking skills. With robust error handling and customization options, it is a versatile tool for educators and e-learning platforms, simplifying the process of generating varied and impactful assessments.

In contemporary education, the manual creation of diverse and challenging assessments is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Educators and e-learning platforms face the challenge of generating effective subjective and objective test questions that align with the content's context. There is a need for an innovative solution that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automate the generation of both subjective and objective test questions. This system should not only streamline the assessment creation process but also enhance the quality of questions, fostering critical thinking and providing a dynamic and adaptable testing environment. The project aims to address this gap by developing an Automated Test Generation System that efficiently analyzes educational content and generates contextually relevant, diverse, and challenging questions for a more effective and engaging learning experience.

To address the challenges posed by manual test creation in education, our solution is an Automated Test Generation System leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system comprises two key components: the SubjectiveTest and ObjectiveTest classes.
SubjectiveTest Class:
Utilizes NLP for content analysis, breaking down educational material into meaningful chunks.
Dynamically generates subjective questions based on identified patterns and key concepts.
Ensures that questions are contextually relevant, fostering a deeper understanding of the subject matter.
ObjectiveTest Class:
Applies NLP to identify trivial sentences within the content, forming the basis for objective questions.
Utilizes WordNet for generating diverse and contextually appropriate answer options, enhancing the comprehensiveness of assessments.
Contributes to the development of questions that promote critical thinking and analytical skills among learners
